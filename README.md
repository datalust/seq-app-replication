# Replicator

The `Seq.App.Replication` plug-in, which forwards incoming events to another Seq server.

This app can be used to implement store-and-forward, or limited disaster recovery. For reliable built-in disaster recovery, 
see [Setting up a DR Instance](https://docs.datalust.co/docs/setting-up-a-disaster-recovery-dr-instance) in the Seq documentation.
